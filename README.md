# Cryptolearn

Cryptolearn is an interactive, web-based educational project designed to make core cryptography concepts easier to understand through clear explanations, visual structure, and practical examples.

The goal of this project is not to turn users into cryptographers overnight, but to help them build correct mental models about how modern cryptography works and why it matters.
