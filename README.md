# Cryptolearn 🛡️
**A Comprehensive Roadmap to Mastering Modern Cryptography**

Welcome to **Cryptolearn**, an open-source educational repository dedicated to demystifying the world of cryptography. This project serves as a structured path for students, developers, and security enthusiasts to journey from the basics of ancient ciphers to the complexities of post-quantum security.

---

## 📖 Overview
Cryptography is the backbone of digital privacy and blockchain technology. This repository provides a deep dive into the mathematical foundations and practical applications of cryptographic protocols, documented primarily in Persian to support the local developer community.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### 1. 🧮 Mathematical Foundations
* Number Theory (Prime numbers, Modular arithmetic)
* Discrete Logarithms
* Elliptic Curve Theory (ECC)

### 2. 🔐 Symmetric Key Cryptography
* Block Ciphers (AES, DES)
* Stream Ciphers (ChaCha20)
* Modes of Operation (CBC, GCM, etc.)

### 3. 🔑 Asymmetric Key Cryptography (PKI)
* RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
* Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
* Digital Signature Algorithms (DSA, ECDSA)

### 4. ⚡ Hashing & Integrity
* Message Digest (MD5 - for historical context)
* Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-2, SHA-3)
* HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)

### 5. 🌐 Advanced Topics
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
* Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) & Certificates
