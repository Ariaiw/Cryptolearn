# 🦉 Cryptolearn | The Advanced Security Roadmap

**Cryptolearn** is a professional-grade, browser-based cryptographic suite designed to demystify the complex world of digital security. Built for developers and curious minds, it bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical implementation.



---

## 🚀 Features

- **SHA-256 HMAC Engine**: Generate and verify digital fingerprints with secret-key salting.
- **AES-256 GCM Suite**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption and decryption.
- **RSA Key Architect**: Generate 2048-bit industrial-grade public/private key pairs locally.
- **Privacy First**: 100% Client-side. No servers, no tracking, no logs.
- **Educational Roadmap**: Integrated guides for Integrity, Confidentiality, and Authenticity.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Logic**: Pure JavaScript (Web Crypto API)
* **Styling**: Modern CSS3 with CSS Variables (Dark Mode Optimized)
* **Security**: PBKDF2 for key derivation, AES-GCM for encryption, SHA-256 for integrity.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Ariaiw/Cryptolearn.git](https://github.com/Ariaiw/Cryptolearn.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in Browser**: Just open `index.html`. No dependencies or servers required.
3.  **Explore**: Use the **Suite** to encrypt messages or verify hashes. Click the `?` icons to learn the "Why" behind the "How".



## 🛡 Security Philosophy

The core principle of this project is **Zero-Trust**. By using the browser's native `crypto.subtle` interface, all sensitive operations occur in a volatile memory space that clears upon tab closure. 

> "Cryptography is not about hiding information, it's about making sure the right people have it."
